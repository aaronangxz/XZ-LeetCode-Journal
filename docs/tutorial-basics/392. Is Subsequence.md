# 392. Is Subsequence

## Question 
Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` if `s` is a **subsequence** of `t`, or `false` otherwise.

A **subsequence** of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "`ace`" is a subsequence of "`abcde`" while "`aec`" is not).

Example 1:
```
Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true
```
Example 2:
```
Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: false
```

Constraints:
```
0 <= s.length <= 100
0 <= t.length <= 104
s and t consist only of lowercase English letters.
```

Follow up: Suppose there are lots of incoming s, say s1, s2, ..., sk where k >= 109, and you want to check one by one to see if t has its subsequence. In this scenario, how would you change your code?

## Approach

1. Iterate through `t`, and match against `s` start from the first index in `s`.
2. If there is a match, move to the next index in `s`, and also take note of the index of the previous matched element.
3. After iterate through all elements in `t` if index of `s` is not at the end, that means some elements weren't matched.

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isSubsequence(string s, string t) {
        int j = 0;
        
        for(int i = 0; i < t.size(); i++) if(t[i] == s[j]) j++;
        
        if(j != s.size()) return false;
        
        return true;
    }
};
```
