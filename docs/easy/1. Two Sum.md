# 1. Two Sum

## Question 
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

You may assume that each input would have **exactly one solution**, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
```
Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]
```
Example 3:
```
Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]
```

Constraints:
```
2 <= nums.length <= 104
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109
-109 <= target <= 109
Only one valid answer exists.
```

## Approach

1. Create a hash table with int pairs, which the key would be the number in `nums`, value would be the index of this number in `nums`.
2. Iterate through `nums`, and check if (`target` minus current number) exists in map as a key.
3. If not, insert pair into map.
4. If yes, that means we have found the two numbers that adds up to `target`.
5. Return result will be <index found in map, index of current element>.

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        unordered_map<int,int> m;
        vector<int> out;
        
        for(int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++){
            if(m.count(target - nums[i])){
                out.push_back(m[target - nums[i]]);
                out.push_back(i);
            }else{
                m[nums[i]] = i;
            }
        }
        return out;
    }
};

```
