# [WIP] 695. Max Area of Island

## Question 
You are given an m x n binary matrix grid. An island is a group of 1's (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

The area of an island is the number of cells with a value 1 in the island.

Return the maximum area of an island in grid. If there is no island, return 0.

Example 1:
```
Input: grid = [[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]]
Output: 6
Explanation: The answer is not 11, because the island must be connected 4-directionally.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: grid = [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]
Output: 0
```

Constraints:
- m == grid.length
- n == grid[i].length
- 1 <= m, n <= 50
- grid[i][j] is either 0 or 1.

## Approach


## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxAreaOfIsland(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        //empty grid to record flag
        vector<vector<bool>> flag(grid.size(),vector<bool> (grid[0].size()));
        int maxArea = 0;
        
        for(int i = 0; i < grid.size(); i++){
            for(int j = 0; j < grid[0].size(); j++){
                maxArea = max(maxArea,checkCells(grid,flag,i,j));
            }
        }
        return maxArea;
    }
    
    int checkCells(vector<vector<int>>& grid, vector<vector<bool>>& flag,int i, int j){
        if(flag[i][j]) return 0;
        else flag[i][j] = true;
        
        int area = 0;
        
        if(grid[i][j] > 0) area = 1;
        else return 0;
        
        //left
        if(i > 0) area += checkCells(grid,flag,i - 1,j);
        
        //right
        if(i < grid.size() - 1) area += checkCells(grid,flag,i + 1,j);
        
        //up
        if(j > 0) area += checkCells(grid,flag,i,j - 1);
        
        //down
        if(j < grid[0].size() - 1) area += checkCells(grid,flag,i,j + 1);
        
        return area;
    }
};
```
