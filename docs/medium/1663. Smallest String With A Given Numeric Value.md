# 1663. Smallest String With A Given Numeric Value

## Question 
The **numeric value** of a **lowercase character** is defined as its position `(1-indexed)` in the alphabet, so the numeric value of `a` is `1`, the numeric value of `b` is `2`, the numeric value of `c` is `3`, and so on.

The **numeric value** of a **string** consisting of lowercase characters is defined as the sum of its characters' numeric values. For example, the numeric value of the string `"abe"` is equal to `1 + 2 + 5 = 8`.

You are given two integers n and k. Return the **lexicographically smallest string** with **length** equal to n and **numeric value** equal to `k`.

Note that a string `x` is lexicographically smaller than string `y` if `x` comes before `y` in dictionary order, that is, either `x` is a prefix of `y`, or if `i` is the first position such that `x[i] != y[i]`, then `x[i]` comes before `y[i]` in alphabetic order.

Example 1:
```
Input: n = 3, k = 27
Output: "aay"
Explanation: The numeric value of the string is 1 + 1 + 25 = 27, and it is the smallest string with such a value and length equal to 3.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: n = 5, k = 73
Output: "aaszz"
```

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 105
n <= k <= 26 * n

---

## Approach
1. Create a string of len `n` (the length of return string) and populate it with `'a'` (the smallest in lexicographically order).
2. `k` is the total max, `k` - `n` is the max string needed.
3. Check `k` and 25 (= `z`), whichever that is smaller will be placed at the back.
4. Minus the string number of the places char, and continue until k is 0.
5. The rest of the string will be kept as `a`.

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string getSmallestString(int n, int k) {
        string res(n, 'a');
        k -= n;
        
        int i = res.size() - 1;
        while (k > 0) {
            int tmp = min(k, 25);
            res[i] += tmp;
            k -= tmp;
            --i;
        }
        
        return res;
    }
};
```
