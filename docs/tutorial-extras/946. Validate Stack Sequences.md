# 946. Validate Stack Sequences

## Question 
Given two integer arrays `pushed` and `popped` each with distinct values, return `true` if this could have been the result of a sequence of push and pop operations on an initially empty stack, or `false` otherwise.

Example 1:
```
Input: pushed = [1,2,3,4,5], popped = [4,5,3,2,1]
Output: true
Explanation: We might do the following sequence:
push(1), push(2), push(3), push(4),
pop() -> 4,
push(5),
pop() -> 5, pop() -> 3, pop() -> 2, pop() -> 1
```
Tracking
```
pushed[0] => 1
stack = {1}
top != popped[0] => 4

pushed[1] => 2
stack = {1,2}
top != popped[0] => 4

pushed[2] => 3
stack = {1,2,3}
top != popped[0] => 4

pushed[3] => 4
stack = {1,2,3,4}
top == popped[0] => 4, hence pop top. stack = {1,2,3}
check the next in popped
top != popped[1] => 5

pushed[4] => 5
stack = {1,2,3,5}
top == popped[1] => 5, hence pop top. stack = {1,2,3}
top == popped[2] => 3, hence pop top. stack = {1,2}
top == popped[3] => 2, hence pop top. stack = {1}
top == popped[4] => 1, hence pop top. stack = {}

stack is empty, return true
```
Example 2:
```
Input: pushed = [1,2,3,4,5], popped = [4,3,5,1,2]
Output: false
Explanation: 1 cannot be popped before 2.
```

Constraints:
```
1 <= pushed.length <= 1000
0 <= pushed[i] <= 1000
All the elements of pushed are unique.
popped.length == pushed.length
popped is a permutation of pushed.
```

## Approach

1. Iterate through `pushed` and push onto stack.
2. At the same time, check if the top of the stack is equals to elements in `popped`.
3. If yes, that means it is a valid stack, so we can pop the top and check the next index in `popped`. Stop when either there is no more items in stack or it does not match `popped`.
4. Continue the same for the next element in `pushed`.
5. After checking every element in `pushed`, if there is still remaining items in the stack that means this is not a valid stack sequence.

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool validateStackSequences(vector<int>& pushed, vector<int>& popped) {
        stack<int> s;
        int j = 0;
        
        for(int i = 0; i < pushed.size(); i++){
            s.push(pushed[i]);
            
            while(!s.empty() && s.top() == popped[j]){
                s.pop();
                j++;
            }
        }
        return s.empty();
    }
};
```
